- **Algorithms**: Most candidates have a good grasp, but Michael could use more practice.
- **SQL**: Michael has a strong score, but Timo and Matthew could improve.
- **Linear Algebra**: All candidates have lower scores, indicating a need for more focus.
- **Probability**: Only Matthew has some knowledge, suggesting this topic should be included.
- **Deep Learning** and **Transformers**: None of the candidates have exposure to these topics, indicating a significant gap.

To improve the course "Intro to Machine Learning," I suggest the following:

1. **Add Missing Topics**: Include "Data Structures," "Algorithms," "Probability," "Deep Learning," and "Transformers" to cover the gaps identified in job requirements and candidate skills.
2. **Update Outdated Topics**: Ensure that the content on "Linear Algebra" is up-to-date and relevant to current machine learning practices.
3. **Provide More Practical Exercises**: Incorporate hands-on projects and exercises that allow candidates to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios, especially in areas like "Deep Learning" and "Transformers."

Final Answer: To improve the course "Intro to Machine Learning," add topics such as "Data Structures," "Algorithms," "Probability," "Deep Learning," and "Transformers." Update the content on "Linear Algebra" and provide more practical exercises to enhance learning outcomes.
